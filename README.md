#############  Build-Server-OCD-and-prototype ####################



This project mainly focuses on creating  an Operational Concept Document (OCD) for a Remote Build Server, and a small prototype demonstrating programmable builds.


This is Software modelling analysis course project which has the below Requirements


Your Build Server OCD



Shall be prepared as a Microsoft Office Word file, using embedded Visio Diagrams3.

Shall explore and describe the user interface(s) you will provide.


Shall partition processing into at least the top-level packages.


Shall describe the uses/responsibilities, activities, events, and interactions of each of the packages in your concept.


Shall use both text and diagrams for the descriptions in 4, above.


Shall prepare a Visual Studio Project builder code prototype4 which:
Loads a Visual Studio project from a specified path, that refers to C# packages in subdirectories, and attempts to build the project.


Reports success or failure, and any warnings encountered by the build.



Discuss the prototype results and draw conclusions about what you've learned from the prototypes, in your OCD.


Shall document prototype code you develop in an Appendix. You don't need to include source code in your OCD document (please don't), but you do need to discuss the prototype design and show outputs.
